# Digital-Library-System
A Python-based Digital Library Management System that allows users to add, search, mark as read, delete, and view books in a dynamic list. Perfect for beginners to practice with lists, variables, functions, and conditional statements (if-else).

## Description
The **Digital Library System** is a Python-based project designed for beginners to practice and enhance their understanding of Python lists, functions, variables, and `if-else` statements. This system allows users to:
- Add new books to the library
- Search for books by name
- Mark books as "read"
- Delete books from the library
- View all books in the collection

It's a fun and interactive way to build programming skills while working on a practical project.

## Features
1. **Add Books**: Store book details like name, author, publication year, and status.
2. **Search Books**: Look for books by their name.
3. **Mark Books as Read**: Update the status of a book to "Read."
4. **Delete Books**: Remove unwanted books from the collection.
5. **View All Books**: See the entire library with statuses.

## How It Works
- Books are stored in a list where each book is represented as a dictionary.
- The program offers a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
- Users can perform actions by selecting menu options.

## Code Overview
The project is divided into several functions for modularity:
- `add_book()`: Add a new book to the library.
- `search_book()`: Find a book by its name.
- `mark_as_read()`: Mark a book as "read."
- `delete_book()`: Remove a book from the library.
- `show_books()`: Display all books in the library.
